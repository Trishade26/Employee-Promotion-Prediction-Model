# Employee-Promotion-Prediction-Model

The project focuses on optimizing the employee promotion process for a large multinational corporation with nine business verticals. The client faces challenges in identifying the right candidates for managerial promotions and preparing them effectively. Currently, employees are selected based on past performance and recommendations, then go through separate training programs tailored to each vertical. However, the process lacks consistency, is resource-intensive, and doesn't always focus on proactive leadership development.

The project aims to:

 * Standardize promotion criteria across all verticals.

 * Create optimized, cross-vertical training and development paths.

 * Use data-driven insights to make more objective promotion decisions.

 * Ensure timely preparation of employees for leadership roles.

The goal is to streamline the process, reduce inefficiencies, and build a consistent pipeline of prepared leaders for the organization.
